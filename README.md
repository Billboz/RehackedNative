# ReHacked (September 14, 2016): Going Native with React
### By [ReactJS Tampa Bay](http://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Tampa-Bay/)

Welcome to **ReHacked: Going Native with React**! In this lab we will build an iOS application with simple authorization and navigation. We will use the same node [API](https://github.com/reactjstampabay/rehacked-spa-basics-api) as we did for our last lab on [Redux basics](https://github.com/reactjstampabay/rehacked-redux-basics).

Apple only allows us to develop for iOS on a Mac, so this lab will focus on OS X.

By the end of this lab, you will have:

* Installed all required React Native dependencies
* Installed [React Native command line interface](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content)
* Initialized a new React Native Project
* Run and Debug an iOS App
* Wired up simple authentication against a node API
* Wired up basic navigation
* Connected a React Native application to Redux
* Implemented the Native Camera
* Implemented a Vector Icons Library

This `master` branch represents a completed solution set for the lab.  We have separated the lab into logical "breakpoints" by use of branches.  Please see below to get started.
