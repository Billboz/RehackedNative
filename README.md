## Goal 1: Add the Camera

### Explanation

* In this step, we will build out the Camera component

### Instructions

1. In a termianl window at the root of the project, run the following to install the camera dependency, `npm i react-native-camera@https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera.git --save`
 * We are installing from the GitHub repo vs npm to ensure we are using the latest goodness.
1. Run the following `react-native link react-native-camera` to automatically link the camera to the native platforms
 * More information on [Linking Libraries](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html)
